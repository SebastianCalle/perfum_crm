# This file makes the 'models' directory a Python package.
# It can be empty.

# You can optionally import models here to make them available 
# directly from the package, e.g.:
# from .inventory_model import Fragrance, Bottle
# but for Base.metadata.create_all() to work by just importing the module,
# simply ensuring the module (inventory_model.py) is executed is enough.
